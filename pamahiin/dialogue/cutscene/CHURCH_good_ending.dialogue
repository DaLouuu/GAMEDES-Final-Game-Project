The booth is quiet as you kneel.
Your voice trembles, but the truth spills clean.

Behind the screen, something listens… then recedes.

“You listened.
You gave what was asked… fully.”

A faint warmth brushes your shoulder—
gentle, but not human.

“We do not forget respect.”

The door opens on its own.
“Go. For now.
The path outside will… leave you be.”

You step out
The air feels lighter… 
…but the shadows still watch, patient.”
