Janna: Sergeant? I’m Janna. With the Manila Times. 
You: *Walking past her* Not today, Miss. 
Janna: *Matching his pace* I saw the coffin. That was the girl from the Bontoc village, wasn’t it? The weaver? 
You: It was a job. It’s done. 
Janna: It’s not done. There are dozens more, Sergeant. In the warehouses in St. Louis. In the university basements. They’re just... sitting in boxes. 
You: *Stopping, agitated* I am a courier, not a savior. I brought one back. That is all the funding covered. 
Janna: Then we find more funding. You saw their faces today. You saw that old man. You can’t tell me you don’t feel the weight of it. 
You: The only thing I feel is tired. 
Janna: If you leave them there, they never rest. And neither will you. 
You stare at her. Her words strike too close to the Native’s warning. You clench your jaw, pushing the thought away. 
You: I’m going to sleep, Miss. Do not follow me. 
You turn away abruptly. 
Janna watches you go, then turns toward the town center, respecting the custom. 
You ignore the branching path to the cantina. You ignore the small store. You walk in a straight line, alone, directly toward your lodging.
