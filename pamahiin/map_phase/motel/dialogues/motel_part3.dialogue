You gasp, jolting upright in bed. Your hands fly instantly to your mouth. 
You run your tongue over your teeth. They are there. Solid. Real. 
You exhale, shaking. Sunlight bleeds through the cracks in the wooden walls, but the light looks wrong. It is sickly, sepia-toned. 
The room is silent. The basin is clean. The mirror is whole. 
But the air smells of sawdust and old popcorn. The smell of the Fair. 
You stand up. You are not alone. The shadows in the corners of the room are moving. 
The nightmare has not ended. You have simply woken up inside of it.
