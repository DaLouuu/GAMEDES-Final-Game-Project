The door latches shut behind you, cutting off the wind. The silence in the room is heavy. It does not feel empty. 
You toss your hat onto the small desk and sit heavily on the edge of the bed. The mattress is thin; the springs groan under your weight. 
You rub your temples. The high-pitched ringing is there, faint but persistent. Like a mosquito you can’t swat. 
[b]You:[/b] Muttering to yourself Superstition... It’s just the guilt. Just the war. 
You exhale, standing up to prepare for bed. You need to wash the graveyard dirt from your hands.
