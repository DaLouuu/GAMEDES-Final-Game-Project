You wet your toothbrush and dip it into a small tin of tooth powder. The bristles are stiff against your gums. 
You begin to brush, staring blankly at your own tired eyes in the glass. Scrub. Scrub. Scrub. The rhythm is hypnotic. 

Suddenly, the friction changes. A sickening crunch echoes in your jaw, followed by a sensation of something giving way. 
You freeze. Your mouth feels full. Too full. Hard, loose pebbles roll against your tongue. The taste of copper fills your mouth. 
You lean over the basin and spit. 

Panic seizes you. You drop the brush. Your trembling hand goes to your mouth. You run your tongue over your gums. 
Smooth. Empty. Soft, raw flesh where bone should be. 

You look up at the mirror in sheer terror, your mouth gaping open in a silent, toothless scream. 
Your reflection does not scream. It smiles. Its mouth is filled with your teeth—row upon row of them, jagged and overflowing.

The reflection lunges forward, slamming its head against the glass from the inside. Sound of shattering glass
