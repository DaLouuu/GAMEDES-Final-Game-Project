The sheets are still warm, but the warmth feels wrong—like it isn’t yours.
The pillow bears an imprint deeper than your head could make, as if something else had been lying beside you.
A faint chemical smell clings to the blanket. Not sleep. Not human.
You reach toward the bed, but your hand stops on its own. The frame gives a soft creak—too soft, too expectant.
This isn’t a place to rest. Not in this nightmare.
You step back. The bed settles, almost like a sigh.
