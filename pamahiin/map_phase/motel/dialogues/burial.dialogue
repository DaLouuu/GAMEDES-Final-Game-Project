Native: *Without looking* You do not look well, Amerikano.
You: The heat. The… altitude.
Native: It is not the mountain. It is what you carry. *Beating intensifies* She does not let you sleep.
Your blood runs cold. You turned your head to the native. The wailing he hears in his dreams, a constant, high-pitched lament, flashes in his mind.
You: How would you know that?
Native: I know what a haunted man looks like.
The native turned his head slightly, still gazing at the coffin.
Native: Your government sends a soldier. A man of war. *Scoffs* They do not understand.
You: I was… I was tasked. To bring her home *points at the coffin*. From Missouri. The World’s Fair.
Native: ‘The Fair’ *disgusted face*. We know of this Fair. We were told it was a great journey. A showcase of worlds.
You: It was… an exhibition.
Native: An exhibition. You exhibited them. Like strange birds. You built a village for them, but it was caged. You called them ‘uncivilized’ so you could feel clean about… this. About ruling us.
You: I wasn’t there. I fought in the… I was just a soldier. Following orders. This is the last one.
Native: They took her from here. A weaver. They made her dance for pennies. And when your city’s sickness took her, they took her body. For ‘science’. She was my brother’s daughter.
Your breath hitches. You looked to the native and then to the wooden coffin with a new, profound horror.
You: The wailing…
Native: It is her. She followed the one who held her bones. The one who broke the rules. You.
Native: You bring these remains. You think this is home. You are her anchor to this world now. Her spirit is not in that coffin, soldier. It is lost. It is trapped… and it is attached to you.
The native turns and walks out of the chapel, leaving you alone on the bench, the wail already beginning to echo in the edges of his hearing.
