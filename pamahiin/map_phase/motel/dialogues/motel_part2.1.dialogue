You wet your toothbrush and dip it into a small tin of tooth powder. The bristles are stiff against your gums. 
You begin to brush, staring blankly at your own tired eyes in the glass. Scrub. Scrub. Scrub. The rhythm is hypnotic. 
Suddenly, the friction changes. A sickening crunch echoes in your jaw, followed by a sensation of something giving way. 
You freeze. Your mouth feels full. Too full. Hard, loose pebbles roll against your tongue. The taste of copper fills your mouth. 
You lean over the basin and spit.
