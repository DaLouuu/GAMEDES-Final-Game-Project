#  TREE NOTES (mother speaking to her child)
############################################################

~ wind_tree
Sign: [A soft carving circles the bark like a breeze passing through fingers.]
Sign: My child… your sister used to stand here and listen for the wind.
Sign: She said it carried stories — ones she wished she could follow.
Sign: When she left, I would find her ribbons tied to these branches…
Sign: …as if she wanted the wind to remember her when we could not.

Player: “…She must have stood here often.”
Player: “Maybe the wind was the only thing that answered her back.”
=> END


~ spiral_tree
Sign: [A spiral is etched into the wood, looping in on itself.]
Sign: Do you remember how your sister spun in circles until she fell laughing?
Sign: She carved this swirl the day she said the world felt too heavy to turn.
Sign: I tried to tell her the world turns for us — even when we are tired…
Sign: …but she only smiled, as if she already felt herself slipping away.

Player: “…A moment she tried to hold onto.”
Player: “Even the dizziness feels sad.”
=> END


~ eye_tree
Sign: [A single eye is carved into the trunk, watching quietly.]
Sign: She drew eyes everywhere… on stones, leaves, even my baskets.
Sign: She said someone far away might see through them —
Sign: …someone she missed, someone she feared forgetting.
Sign: And now, sometimes at night… I feel these carvings watching back.

Player: “…She was afraid of being forgotten.”
Player: “Even by the ones she waited for.”
=> END


~ tally_tree
Sign: [Uneven tally marks climb the trunk like years stacked on years.]
Sign: When your sister was taken, I began marking each day she was gone.
Sign: At first, they were neat, hopeful lines… waiting for her footsteps.
Sign: But the new scratches — the small, uneven ones — those aren’t mine.
Sign: Someone else continued the counting… as if time itself refused to stop.

Player: “…Someone small. Or someone fading.”
Player: “Trying to keep her story from ending.”
=> END


~ hollow_tree
Sign: [A dark hollow opens at the base, scraped clean as if something hid here.]
Sign: Your sister used to leave gifts inside hollows just like this —
Sign: Smooth stones, bird feathers, the things she loved quietly.
Sign: She said the little folk watched over them… if you treated them gently.
Sign: But when she vanished… the hollows stayed empty. And angry.

Player: “…So the dwendes remembered her too.”
Player: “No wonder they’re restless now.”
=> END

#  GATE SIGNAGE — MAIN ENTRANCE LORE
############################################################

~ gate_signage
Sign: [The handwriting is steady, patient — a mother’s voice.]
Sign: My child… before I go, keep our path swept clean.
Sign: Your sister used to tend this garden each morning — she said spirits wander more gently when the ground is cared for.
Sign: When she left, she took her broom with her… and never returned.
Sign: If you must enter, remember what she believed:  
Sign: A swept path is a safe path.

Player: “…She kept this place alive before everything changed.”
Player: “Maybe finishing what she started will help her find her way back.”
=> END

#  WELL SIGNAGE — CRAFTING LORE (dialogue only)
############################################################

~ well_signage
Sign: [The note is damp, edges softened by time.]
Sign: My child… your sister once tried to make her own broom.
Sign: She collected sticks for days — said she wanted to guide lost spirits home.
Sign: But she never finished it. She said her hands felt too weak… too tired.
Sign: If you are here, perhaps you can finish what she began.

Player: “…She tried so hard, even when she was fading.”
Player: “I’ll finish it for her.”
=> END


############################################################
#  BOULDER SIGNAGE — BLOCKED PATH
############################################################

~ boulder_signage
Sign: [A large stone blocks the path. A message is carved beside it.]
Sign: This stone rolled down after your sister disappeared.
Sign: I tried to push it aside… but I was alone, and grief is heavier than rock.
Sign: When the nights grew loud, I would sit here, waiting…  
Sign: Hoping she might climb over, or call out, or come home.

Player: “…She never made it past this point.”
Player: “This place held more than just a path — it held her absence.”
=> END

#  FOUND SIGNAGES — LORE FRAGMENTS (three optional notes)
############################################################

~ found_signage_1
Sign: [A torn scrap of wood lies half-buried in the soil.]
Sign: Your sister said the garden changed at night — she heard whispers.
Sign: Not frightening ones… just lonely.
Sign: She wanted to answer them, but I told her never to follow voices in the dark.

Player: “…But she did, didn’t she?”
Player: “She went where no one should go alone.”
=> END


~ found_signage_2
Sign: [The writing trembles as if written during worry.]
Sign: She came home shivering one evening… said she saw lights under the roots.
Sign: I told her the little folk were restless — that they felt what we felt.
Sign: But she only said, “Maybe they’re calling someone else… someone lost like me.”

Player: “…The dwendes weren’t hunting.”
Player: “They were echoing her.”
=> END


~ found_signage_3
Sign: [A final note, weathered, its ink blurred by rain.]
Sign: My child… if you find this, then I have gone searching for her.
Sign: I can’t bear to sit and wait while the garden grows quieter.
Sign: If I don’t return… keep her memory alive.
Sign: She wanted to come home. She tried. I promise she tried.

Player: “…This garden is full of their echoes.”
Player: “Both the living… and the ones who slipped away.”
=> END
